### Who are you?
We are a team of 3 folks who are interested in building new projects to practice their new learnings. We have decided to build this project after seeing a tutorial of similar kind. We wanted to implement this GitAlert app idea to solve real world usage which a new contributors faced while doing open-source. they don't know what and where to find **Good-First-issue** and this app will help them by randomly finding issue and get automated alert on their email or SMS.

<h3>Additional Resources/Info</h3>
